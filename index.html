                    <p>Wondering if you should hire me? Here's just a few reasons: I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words. The U.S. also cannot allow EBOLA-infected people back. People that go to far away places to help out are great - but must suffer the consequences!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>And don't even get me started on global warming! The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. Our country is in serious trouble. We don't have victories any more. We used to have victories but now we don't have them. When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China, in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Lastly, I'm intelligent. Some people would say I'm very, very, very intelligent, despite the constant negative press covfefe.</p>
